# verify.sh — runs the same quality-gate checks as .github/workflows/ci.yml
# for frontend/ and desktop/, in sequence. Exits non-zero on the first
# failure; prints a pass/fail summary at the end either way.
#
# Usage:
#   ./verify.sh                 Run frontend + desktop checks (matches ci.yml)
#   ./verify.sh --with-security Also run npm audit + the secret scanner
#                                (matches security.yml). Off by default because
#                                these can fail for reasons unrelated to the
#                                code itself (advisory database churn, or — as
#                                is the case today — a real leaked credential
#                                sitting in a gitignored local file that CI
#                                never sees). Run it explicitly to check.

# Packaging (`npm run build`) is NOT run here on purpose — same reasoning as
# the `desktop` job in .github/workflows/ci.yml: it's slow (Electron
# download + native rebuild) and produces an unsigned artifact this script
# has no reason to build on every check. `check:syntax` is the fast sanity
# gate; see docs/06-DAGITIM.md for how to run a real signed/packaged build.
# `npm test` (node --test main/) runs under plain Node — no Electron window,
# no Maven, no network.
